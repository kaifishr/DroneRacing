# SpaceDrones ðŸš€

*SpaceDrones* provides a simple learning environment for genetic optimization with many possible extensions. The drones' goal is to navigate through an environment, covering as much distance as possible in a certain period of time. 

Under the hodde, *SpaceDrones* uses *PyBox2D* for the rigid physics simulation and *Pygame* for visualization. The visualization can be turned off and on by clicking on the *Pygame* window or by pressing the space bar. Turning off the visualization greatly accelerates the optimization process.

# Method

*SpaceDrones* uses *PyBox2D* to create a physical environemnt the drones can interact with. Drones use ray casting to gather distance information about obstacles in their surrounding. This information is fed into the drone's neural network to predict the next set of actions. These actions are passed on to the engines and command the power at which they should run.

The drones' fitness is determined by the distance covered during one generation. The neural network weights of the fittest drone are mutated and passed on to the next generation of drones.

Drones are deactivated for the current generation when they collide with other objects.

# Maps

*SpaceDrones* comes with different worlds that vary in difficulty. Depending on the map, the drones learn different flight behavior. Maps can be easily added or modified.
