# BoosterBox

The goal of BoosterBox is to cover as much distance as possible without colliding with any wall.

# Method

- Gentic optimization method.
- Rendering can be turned off by pressing 'Space' to accelerate optimization.

# Experiments

- Used parameters
- Number of agents.
- Initial configuration of agents is square.

# Results

- Add image after $0$ and $N$ epochs.
- Add graph showing score.

# TODO:
- Add some text to readme.
- Add ray tracing
    - Begin first tests without ray tracing. Just compute distances to walls.
