# Flyer

The goal of Flyer was to built an environment for an agent with the simple task of covering as much distance as possible and to avoid collisions with the domains border.

# Method

The environment consists of a square box with rigid walls, containing one or more Flyers. Each Flyer consists of a square body with four boosters attached to each side. Additionally, each Flyer is equipped with a distance meter that looks in four directions.
